## Diet Coke button for mom

A simple webapp with a Diet Coke button. Upon pressing it, you get notified through email and/or SMS the user of the button wants a diet Coke.

Originally made for a friend that who came up with this idea for his mother's birthday, as she really likes Diet Coke.

## Setup

For the time being, the setup for this involves forking the project, adding your desired forms of contact info for notifications, and hosting it on your desired webapp platform.
I wasn't intending on making this public originally, hence the slight awkwardness of the setup process.

Recommended steps:
<ol>
  <li> Fork the project through GitHub </li>
  <li> Edit the app.py </li>
  <li> Crate a new project on a cloud platform such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), and choose the option to build from GitHub. Then paste the link to the fork of this project you juts made. </li>
  I mention Heroku because it offers free hosting for one project, but feel free to use other ones if you're familiar with any.
